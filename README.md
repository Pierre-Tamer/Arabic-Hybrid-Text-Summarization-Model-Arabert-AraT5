#Arabic-Hybrid-Text-Summarization-Model-Arabert-AraT5
This project focused on developing an Arabic Text Summarization model by combining two powerful NLP models: AraBERT and AraT5. The hybrid model was designed to efficiently summarize Arabic text, making it easier to digest large volumes of content. Throughout this project, I gained substantial experience in Natural Language Processing (NLP), particularly in the nuances of working with the Arabic language. I also learned how to fine-tune pre-trained models, evaluate the performance of NLP algorithms, and handle large datasets. The project was executed on Google Colab, where I leveraged cloud computing resources to train and test the model effectively.
